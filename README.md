# Peek
Take a peek at your server's usage statistics.

### What is Peek?
Peek is a simple utility tool designed for production-level servers that allows system administrators, database architects, etc to decisively take quick action based upon system resource usage. 

It can also be used if you're curious about how much RAM or CPU usage a (linux or darwin derivative)device is using.
