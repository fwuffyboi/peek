  # The trusted proxies to use. Trusted proxies are IP addresses on the Public WAN or private LAN that are officially
  # trusted by Peek to be able to forward and serve this page on behalf of this server. Use this if you are reverse-proxying
  # as the server will trust the IP address of the proxy hence client information will actually be correct. This is a ]
  # security feature more than anything else. If you are not reverse-proxying, you can leave this as is.
  # Default: ["127.0.0.1", "localhost"]
